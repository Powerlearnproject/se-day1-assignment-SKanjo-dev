Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and sytstems that power various aspects of human life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of high-level programming languages. The genesis of high-level programming languages, such as Fortran(19570 and COBOL(1959), revolutionized software development by allowing programmers to write code that was more abstract and closer to human language.The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
System design- creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards.
Deployment-releasing the software to users.
Maintenance-providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements of the software after deployment. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology provides a sequential approach with distinct phases( eg.,requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall while the Agile methodology has an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code for example.,Visual Studio and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems are software tools tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example., Git and Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
