#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and sytstems that power various aspects of human life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of high-level programming languages. The genesis of high-level programming languages, such as Fortran(19570 and COBOL(1959), revolutionized software development by allowing programmers to write code that was more abstract and closer to human language.The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
System design- creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards.
Deployment-releasing the software to users.
Maintenance-providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements of the software after deployment. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology provides a sequential approach with distinct phases( eg.,requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall while the Agile methodology has an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code for example.,Visual Studio and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems are software tools tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example., Git and Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt. Strategies employed to mitigate these challenges include providing clear and effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reasssessment of project goals.                         

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Unit testing involves examining individual components or functions of the software in isolation to verify their correctness. Developers typically perform this testing during the coding phase to identify and fix issues early in the development process.
 Integration Testing: After unit testing, integration testing assesses the interactions between different modules or components to ensure they work together as intended. This level of testing helps detect issues related to data flow and control between integrated units
 System Testing: System testing evaluates the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements. This phase includes testing the system's functionality, performance, security, and other non-functional aspects to ensure it operates as expected in a real-world environment.
 Acceptance Testing: Acceptance testing determines whether the software satisfies the end-users' needs and requirements. Conducted by the client or end-users, this testing ensures that the software is ready for deployment and use in the production environment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions and statements to get the best possible answers from an AI model. Prompt engineering helps avoid vague answers by creating clear and specific answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about Engineers" is an example of a vague prompt because the statement is dynamic and there are very disciplines of engineering. "Tell me about Biomedical Engineers" is a more specific and concise statement that an AI model would give a precise response to.It would tailor its responses to the medical field rather than talk about Enginnering as a dynamic entity.
